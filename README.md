# Notes App
### A simple WYSIWYG rich-text editor clone of iCloud Notes and Notion.

This web application is a simple clone of iCloud Notes and a little bit of Notion. It's purpose is both to provide a simple and intuitive platform for organization and note taking and to teach me all of the fundementals of full-stack web developement in the most effective way possible. Out of all the technolgoy I use in my day-to-day life, I use the notes on my phone and computer the most, so I thought this would be the most interesting and engaging way for me to begin my journey in software developement. The app itself is written in vanilla **JavaScript** using the **Quill** editor for rich-text funcitonality. The backend is written in **Python** using **Flask** for the server and **SQLite** for the database.
